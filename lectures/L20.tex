\lecture{ 20 --- Practical Optimization with SQL }{\term}{Jeff Zarnett}

To wrap up the topic of query optimization we'll have a video. This goes over the advantages of use of SQL over Java (sorry Java programmers) and digs into the optimization process in a way that hopefully convinces you that it is worth your while to master SQL (and understand your optimizer) rather than try to fight through a lot of blocks of code to do it in your application.

The talk is entitled ``How Modern SQL Databases Come up with Algorithms that You Would Have Never Dreamed Of'' by Lukas Eder: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTPGW1PNy_Y}

Slides available at~\cite{lukaseder}.
