\lecture{ 28 --- More Recovery; ARIES }{\term}{Jeff Zarnett}

\section*{More on Recovery}
The algorithm and the approach we have examined for recovery works and it produces the correct results, but it comes with some drawbacks and performance decreasing elements. 


\section*{ARIES}
In spite of sounding like the name of a NASA program to Mars or some such, the ARIES algorithm is a database recovery routine used by IBM. It relies on three main pillars: write-ahead logging, repeating history during redo, and logging changes when undoing something~\cite{fds}.
